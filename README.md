NOTE
====
    This should be assumed to be a highly unstable kernel. It compiles, but has not been
    tested. I would imagine there will be plenty of required tweaks before it is stable.

DESCRIPTION
===========
    This will be a kernel for the Optimus G.

    I am specifically working on the 3.4.0 kernel for the Sprint LG Optimus G (LS970),
    however I plan to include a branch for the 3.0.21 kernel and am hoping to have it working
    for all variations of the OG (although I only have the Sprint version with which to test).

STATUS
======
    Compiles! Creates a zImage file for j1sp-perf_defconfig
